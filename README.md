# Interval Graph Recognition (IGRecognition)

This old project implements algorithms described in the following paper to determine whether a given graph is an interval graph:

Lex-BFS and Partition Refinement, with Applications to Transitive Orientation, Interval Graph Recognition, and Consecutive Ones Testing
by Michel Habib, Ross McConnell, Christophe Paul, Laurent Viennot

The paper outlines specific data structures to achieve optimal complexity.
However, this implementation does not use those data structures, focusing instead on simplicity and ease of understanding.
